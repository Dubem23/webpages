            <h1>The Cheetah’s Wild Life </h1>
             <a>There are three stages in the life cycle of the cheetah: cub (birth to 18 months),
              adolescence (18 to 24 months) and adult life (24 months and on).The gestation (pregnancy)
              period for the cheetah is 93 days, and litters range in size from one or two up to six cubs
             (the occasional litter of eight cubs has been recorded, but it is rare). Cub mortality is higher in
             protected areas like national parks and wildlife reserves where proximity to large predators is greater 
             than in non-protected areas. In such areas, the cheetah cub mortality can be as high as 90%.Adult life for
             a cheetah in the wild is difficult. Cheetahs in the wild (both male and female combined) have an average age
             span of 10 – 12 years. The average lifespan of an adult male in the wild skews lower (8 years), due in part to
             territorial conflicts with competing groups of males. Adult mortality is one of the most significant limiting
             factors for the growth and survival of the wild cheetah population.</a><br><br><br><br> 

        <h1> Physical Characteristics of Adult Cheetahs</h1>
           <a>Adult cheetahs’ weight averages between 75 and 125 pounds. They can measure from 40 to 60 inches in
             length, measured from the head to the hind quarters. The tail can add a further 24 to 32 inches bringing
              the total overall length up to 7.5 feet. On average, cheetahs stand 28 to 36 inches tall at the shoulder.
              The cheetah is a sexually dimorphic species though it is difficult to identify cheetahs’ sex by appearance
               alone. Male cheetahs are slightly bigger than females and they have larger heads, but they do not display 
               the same degree of physical difference between the sexes of other big cat species like lions.
            Cheetahs have a thin frame with a narrow waist and deep chest. They have large nostrils that allow for
             increased oxygen intake. Cheetahs have a large lungs and hearts connected to a circulatory system with
              strong arteries and adrenals that work in tandem to circulate oxygen through their blood very efficiently.
            With its long legs and very slender body, the cheetah is quite different from all other cats and is the only 
            member of its genus, Acinonyx. The cheetah’s unique morphology and physiology allow it to attain the extreme 
            speeds for which it’s famous.</a><br><br><br><br>

            <h1>Markings</h1>
             <a>The cheetah’s undercoat ranges in color from light tan to a deep gold and is marked by solid black
                 spots. These spots are not open like the rosettes found on a leopard or jaguar’s coat, which is one
                 way to quickly identify the cheetah.Distinctive black tear stripes run from the eyes to the mouth. 
                 The stripes are thought to protect the eyes from the sun’s glare. It is believed that they have the
                 same function as a rifle scope, helping cheetahs focus on their prey at a long distance range by 
                 minimizing the glare of the sun.Cheetah tails end with a bushy tuft encircled by five or six dark
                 rings. These markings provide them with excellent camouflage while hunting and make them more 
                 difficult for other predators to detect. The tail is also thought to be a signaling device, helping
                 young cubs follow their mothers in tall grass. The tip of the tail varies in color from white to
                     black among individuals.</a><br><br><br><br>


            <h1>Cheetah Cubs</h1>
       <a>At birth, the cubs weigh 8.5 to 15 ounces and are blind and helpless. Their mother will groom them patiently,
        purring quietly and providing them warmth and security. After a day or so, the mother will leave the cubs to 
       hunt for herself, so she can continue to care for the cubs. This is the most vulnerable time for the cubs, as
      they are left unprotected. They will live in a secluded nest until they are about six to eight weeks old, being
       regularly moved by their mother from nest to nest to avoid detection by predators. The mother will care for her
       cubs on her own for the next year and a half.At about six weeks of age The cubs begin following their mother on
        her daily travels as she is looking for prey. During these first few months she cannot move far or fast and 
        cub mortality is highest. Fewer than one in 10 cubs will survive during this time, as they perish from
         predation by other large predators such as lions and hyenas, or from injuries. This is the time when life 
         skills are taught.Cheetah cubs have a thick silvery-grey mantle down their back. The mantle helps camouflage
          the cubs by imitating the look of an aggressive animal called a honey badger. This mimicry may help deter 
          predators such as lions, hyenas, and eagles from attempting to kill them. Cubs lose their mantle at about 
          three months of age.</a><br><br><br><br>

           <h1>Hunting</h1>
           <a> Cheetahs are visual hunters. Unlike other big cats cheetahs are diurnal, meaning they hunt in early
             morning and late afternoon. Cheetahs climb ‘playtrees’ or termite mounds to get an optimal vantage point
              for spotting prey against the horizon. The hunt has several components. It includes prey detection, 
              stalking, the chase, tripping (or prey capture), and killing by means of a suffocation bite to the throat.</a><br><br><br><br><br>

           <h1>Diet and Eating</h1>
              <a>The prey species on which the cheetah depends have evolved speed and avoidance techniques that can keep
               them just out of reach. Cheetahs prey includes: gazelles (especially Thomson’s gazelles), impalas and
                other small to medium-sized antelopes, hares, birds, and rodents. Cheetahs will also prey on the calves
                 of larger herd animals.Cheetahs generally prefer to prey upon wild species and avoid hunting domestic 
                 livestock. The exception happening in sick, injured and either old or young and inexperienced cheetahs.
                  Generally, the livestock animals that are lost to predation by cheetahs are also sick, injured and 
                  old/young. Keeping livestock in kraals and utilizing non-lethal means of protection can dramatically 
                  reduce livestock predation</a><br><br><br><br>
